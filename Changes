Revision history for Perl extension Sereal

Sereal is a dependency package that pulls in the real Sereal::Encoder
and Sereal::Decoder.  For the actual changes between Sereal releases,
please see the Encoder and Decoder changelogs:
   * https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/Perl/Decoder/Changes
   * https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/Perl/Encoder/Changes

3.000_003
  - Fixes to Decoder test counts when encoder not installed

3.000_002
  - Fixes to Decoder looks_like_sereal and minor protocol
    rules tweaks.

3.000_001
  - Upgrade to version 3 of the protocol
    * Add Zlib compression support to the protocol
    * Add Zlib support to Encoder/Decoder
    * Add CANONICAL_UNDEF tag to represent PL_sv_undef
    * Change magic header so it is trivial to detect
      and reject utf8 encoded Sereal packets.

2.12 Sun May 11 23:30
  - New options in Decoder: "alias_smallint", "alias_varint_under", and "use_undef"
    allow control aliasing semantics during deserialization. No changes to the Encoder.

2.11 Sun Apr 13 23:09
  - Fix test framework issue with "while each" in perl 5.17 and later

2.10 Sun Apr 13 21:30
  - Fix broken MANIFEST in Decoder/Encoder

2.09 Sun Apr 13 21:15
  - Synchro release with Decoder change.

2.08 Thu Apr 10 22:10 2013
  - Production release for previous changes.

2.070_103 Wed Apr 09 00:33 2013 * DEV RELEASE *
  - Build fixes for Decoder. No changes to Encoder.

2.070_102 Sun Apr 06 17:27 2013 * DEV RELEASE *
  - Fixes for how we load XS so Sereal.pm works properly
    with dev releases.
  - Add scalar_looks_like_sereal as a custom opcode to Decoder.

2.070_101 Sun Apr 06 17:27 2013 * DEV RELEASE *
  - Fix for newer perls.
  - Changes to 'fixver.pl' and version numbering so we do
    a 3 digit minor version, and a 3 digit dev version,
    so once this dev release cycle is done we will be at
    v2.071 everywhere. This eliminates a version numbering
    inconsistency in Sereal.pm from Encoder.pm and Decoder.pm
