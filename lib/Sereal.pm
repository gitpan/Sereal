=head1 NAME

Sereal - Fast, compact, powerful binary (de-)serialization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sereal qw(encode_sereal decode_sereal looks_like_sereal);
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This is an experimental module.
Before using it in production, please get in touch with the authors!>

I<Sereal> is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich
serialization protocol. The Perl encoder is implemented as the
L<Sereal::Encoder> module, the Perl decoder correspondingly as 
L<Sereal::Decoder>. They are distributed separately to allow for
safe upgrading without downtime. (Hint: Upgrade the decoder everywhere
first, then the encoder.)

This C<Sereal> module is a very thin wrapper around both C<Sereal::Encoder>
and C<Sereal::Decoder>. It depends on both and loads both. So if you have
a user of both encoder and decoder, it is enough to depend on a particular
version of C<Sereal> and you'll get the most recent released versions
of C<Sereal::Encoder> and C<Sereal::Decoder> whose version is smaller than
or equal to the version of C<Sereal> you depend on.

The protocol specification and many other bits of documentation
can be found in the github repository. Right now, the specification is at
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/sereal_spec.pod>,
there is a discussion of the design objectives in
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/README.pod>, and the output
of our benchmarks can be seen at
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs>.

=head2 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

It is recommended to use the object-oriented interface of
C<Sereal::Encoder> and C<Sereal::Decoder> if you care about
performance.

You can optionally import three functions from C<Sereal>.
C<encode_sereal> is the same function as L<Sereal::Encoder>'s
C<encode_sereal> function. C<decode_sereal> and C<looks_like_sereal>
are the same as L<Sereal::Decoder>'s functions of the same names.

After loading the C<Sereal> module, both C<Sereal::Encoder> and
C<Sereal::Decoder> are guaranteed to be loaded, so you can use
their object-oriented interface.
